  </p>
  <h5>4. Documentation and publication</h5>
  <p>
    The documentation and publication of the research results are exclusively in anonymized form, without mentioning your name and without providing any information that would allow conclusions to be drawn about your person.

  <h5>6. Storage period</h5>
  <p>
    Anonymized data records are permanently archived and made available for scientific reuse, including by third parties. This data is stored separately. This means that no conclusions can be drawn about your person or the information you provide in the questionnaire.
  </p>
  <h5>7. Disclosure of personal data</h5>
  <p>
    Personal data will not be passed on to third parties. A transfer may only be considered if there is a legal obligation for the transfer in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR or if you have expressly given your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. 
    A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organization is excluded.
  </p>
  <h5>8. Rights of subjects</h5>
  <p>You have the right:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc">
    <li>
      In accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR, to withdraw your consent once given to us at any time. As a result, we may no longer continue the data processing based on this consent in the future;

    </li>
    <li>
      in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR, to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data, insofar as the accuracy of the data is disputed by you, the processing is unlawful, but you refuse to delete it, and we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or you have lodged an objection to the processing in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR;
    </li>
