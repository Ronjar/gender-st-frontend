    with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR or if you have expressly given
    your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. A
    transfer of personal data to a third country or an international
    organization is excluded.
  </p>
  <h5>8. Rights of subjects</h5>
  <p>You have the right:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR, to withdraw your consent once

      processing based on this consent in the future;
    </li>
    <li>
      to request information about your personal data processed by us in
      accordance with Art. 15 GDPR. In particular, you can request information
      about the processing purposes, the category of personal data, the
      categories of recipients to whom your data has been or will be disclosed,

    </li>
    <li>
      in accordance with Art. 16 GDPR, to immediately request the correction of
      incorrect or incomplete personal data stored by us;
    </li>
    <li>
      in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR, to demand the erasure of your personal
      data stored by us, unless the processing is necessary for exercising the
      right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a
      legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or the establishment,
      exercise or defense of legal claims;
    </li>
    <li>
      in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR, to demand the restriction of the
      processing of your personal data, insofar as the accuracy of the data is
      disputed by you, the processing is unlawful, but you refuse to delete it,
      and we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or
      defend legal claims or you have lodged an objection to the processing in
      accordance with Art. 21 GDPR;
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      In accordance with Art. 89 GDPR in conjunction with Section 27 (2) BDSG,
      the rights of Articles 15, 16, 18, and 21 GDPR are limited to the extent
      that these rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the
      achievement of the research or statistical purposes and the restriction is
      necessary for the fulfillment of the research or statistical purposes.
      Furthermore, the right to information in accordance with Article 15 of
      GDPR does not exist if the data is required for scientific research, and
      the provision of information would require a disproportionate effort. The
      application of this article is decided on a case-by-case basis.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>9. Data security</h5>
  <p>
    We use suitable technical and organizational security measures to protect
